# Programming in C++ and C\#

This repository captures all my journey in learning C++ and C\# languages, from basics to object-oriented programming and interedting training projects.

At the moment I use Python far more than C++, but it was definitely worth learning thoroughly C++. It has given strong, solid and deep understanding of different programming concepts like functions, procedures, lists, structures, classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphisme, time and memory complexities, and so forth.

I learned C\# to earn money in online tutoring hahah:), but it was a great experience though.
